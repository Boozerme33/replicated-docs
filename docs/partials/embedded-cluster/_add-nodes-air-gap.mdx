1. Get the join command from the Admin Console:

   1. In the Admin Console, click **Cluster Management** at the top.

   1. Click **Add node**.
   
   1. In the **Add a Node** dialog, select one or more roles for the new node that you will join. If no roles are defined in the Embedded Cluster Config, the role selection will not appear and only the join command is displayed.

    1. Copy the join command.

1. SSH onto the machine you want to join to the cluster.

1. On the machine, download and untar the Embedded Cluster installation assets (including the Embedded Cluster binary and air gap bundle). You can use the same `curl` command that you ran during installation to download the assets.

    :::note
    The Embedded Cluster assets on each node must be the same version. To download a specific version, you can select a version in the **Embedded Cluster install instructions** dialog.
    :::

1. Run the air gap join command that you copied.

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    sudo ./APP_SLUG join --airgap-bundle APP_SLUG.airgap 10.128.0.32:30000 TxXboDstBAamXaPdleSK7Lid
    ```
    Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug.

1. In the Admin Console, on the **Cluster Management** page, verify that the node appears. Wait for the node's status to change to Ready.

1. Repeat these steps for each node you want to add.
