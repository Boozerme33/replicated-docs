1. Get the join command from the Admin Console:

   1. In the Admin Console, click **Cluster Management** at the top.

   1. Click **Add node**, choose one or more node roles (if present), and copy the join command.

1. SSH onto the machine you want to join to the cluster.

1. On the machine, download and untar the Embedded Cluster installation assets (including the Embedded Cluster binary and air gap bundle). You can use the same `curl` command that you ran during installation to download the assets.

    :::note
    The binary and air gap bundles on each node must be the same Embedded Cluster version as what is installed in the cluster. To download a specific version of these assets, you can select a version in the **Embedded Cluster install instructions** dialog.
    :::

1. Run the air gap join command that you copied.

    **For example:**

    ```bash
    sudo ./APP_SLUG join --airgap-bundle APP_SLUG.airgap 10.128.0.32:30000 TxXboDstBAamXaPdleSK7Lid
    ```
    Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug.
