    1. Copy the join command.

1. SSH onto the machine you want to join to the cluster.

1. On the machine, download and untar the Embedded Cluster installation assets. You can use the same `curl` command that you ran during installation to download the assets.

    :::note
    The binary on each node must be the same Embedded Cluster version as what is installed in the cluster. To download a specific version of these assets, you can select a version in the **Embedded Cluster install instructions** dialog.
    :::

1. Run the join command that you copied.

    **For example:**

    ```bash
    sudo ./APP_SLUG join 10.128.0.32:30000 TxXboDstBAamXaPdleSK7Lid
    ```
    Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug.

1. In the Admin Console, click **Cluster Management** at the top.

     When initially installing the application, you are brought to this page automatically after logging into the Admin Console.

1. In the Admin Console, on the **Cluster Management** page, verify that the node appears. Wait for the node's status to change to Ready.

1. Repeat these steps for each node you want to add.
