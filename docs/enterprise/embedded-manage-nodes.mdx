# Adding and Managing Nodes with Embedded Cluster 

The topic describes managing nodes in clusters created with Replicated Embedded Cluster, including how to add or reset nodes and enable high-availability for multi-node clusters.

## Add Nodes (Beta) {#add-nodes}

You can add nodes and create a multi-node cluster. When adding nodes, you select one or more roles for that node, depending on which roles are defined in the Embedded Cluster config. The Admin Console provides the join command you use to join nodes to the cluster.

For more information about defining node roles, see [Roles](/reference/embedded-config#roles) in _Embedded Cluster Config_.

To add nodes to a cluster:

1. In the Admin Console, click **Cluster Management** at the top.

     When initially installing the application, you are brought to this page automatically after logging into the Admin Console.

1. Click **Add node**.

1. In the **Add a Node** dialog, select one or more roles for this node. If no custom roles are defined, the role selection will not appear and only the join command will show.

1. Copy the provided join command.

     **Example:**

     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG join 10.128.0.43:30000 bM8DO3MNvkouz9TFK3TcFanI
     ```

1. SSH onto the machine you want to join to the cluster.

     :::important
     You must join nodes with the same installer that you used for the first node. If you use a different installer from a different release of your application, the cluster will not be stable.
     :::

1. Run the join command on the node.

1. In the Admin Console, on the **Cluster Management** page, verify that the node appears. Wait for the node's status to change to Ready.

1. Repeat the process for as many nodes as you would like to add.

## Add Nodes to Air Gap Clusters (Beta) {#add-nodes-air-gap}

You can add nodes to an air gap cluster. This involves downloading the Embedded Cluster assets to each node, copying a join command from the Admin Console, and running the join command on each node.

### Prerequisite

The Embedded Cluster binary and the air gap bundle must be present on each node you want to join to the cluster. Use the same commands as you did during installation to download and untar these assets on each node. For more information, see [Install](#install) above.

:::note
The binary and air gap bundles on each additional node must be the same version as what is currently installed. To download a specific version of these assets, you can select a version in the **Embedded Cluster install instructions** dialog. For more information, see [Install](#install) above.
:::

### Procedure

To add nodes to an air gap cluster after successfully installing the first node:

1. In the Admin Console, click **Cluster Management** at the top.

     When initially installing an application, you are brought to this page automatically after logging into the Admin Console.

1. Click **Add node**, choose one or more node roles (if present), and copy the join command.

1. SSH onto another machine you want to join to the cluster. Run the air gap join command on the node.

    **For example:**

    ```bash
    sudo ./APP_SLUG join --airgap-bundle APP_SLUG.airgap 10.128.0.32:30000 TxXboDstBAamXaPdleSK7Lid
    ```

## Enable High Availability for Multi-Node Clusters (Alpha) {#ha}

Multi-node clusters are not highly available by default. The first node of the cluster is special and holds important data for Kubernetes and KOTS, such that the loss of this node would be catastrophic for the cluster. After three controller nodes are present in the cluster, high availability (HA) can be enabled.

:::important
High availability for Embedded Cluster in an Alpha feature. This feature is subject to change, including breaking changes. To get access to this feature, reach out to Alex Parker at [alexp@replicated.com](mailto:alexp@replicated.com).
:::

### Requirement

High availability is supported with Embedded Cluster 1.4.1 or later.

### Limitations

High availability has the following limitations:

* The `--enable-ha` flag serves as a feature flag during the Alpha phase. In the future, the prompt about migrating to high availability will display automatically if the cluster is not yet HA and you are adding the third or more controller node. 

* Support bundles are now stored in rqlite instead of MinIO because MinIO is no longer deployed. We’ve successfully stored 100 MB support bundles (which is much larger than most support bundles), but bundles over 100 MB can cause rqlite to crash and restart. We are considering making support bundles ephemeral instead of storing them to address this issue, because support bundles are rarely needed long after they’re generated.

### Create a Multi-Node HA Cluster

To create a multi-node HA cluster:

1. Set up a cluster with at least two controller nodes. You can do an online (internet-connected) or air gap installation. For online clusters, see [Add Nodes (Alpha)](#add-nodes) above. For air gap clusters, see [Air Gap Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded-air-gap).

1. SSH onto a third node that you want to join to the cluster as a controller.

1. Run the join command and pass the `--enable-ha` flag. For example:

     ```bash
     sudo ./APP_SLUG join `--enable-ha` 10.128.0.80:30000 tI13KUWITdIerfdMcWTA4Hpf
     ```

1. After the third node joins the cluster, type `y` in response to the prompt asking if you want to enable high availability.

1. Wait for the migration to complete.


## Reset a Node

Resetting a node removes the cluster and your application from that node. This is useful for iteration, development, and when mistakes are made, so you can reset a machine and reuse it instead of having to procure another machine.

If you want to completely remove a cluster, you need to reset each node individually.

When resetting a node, OpenEBS PVCs on the node are deleted. Only PVCs created as part of a StatefulSet will be recreated automatically on another node. To recreate other PVCs, the application will need to be redeployed.

To reset a node:

1. SSH onto the machine. Ensure that the Embedded Cluster binary is still available on that machine. For more information about downloading Embedded Cluster installation assets, see [Online Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded).

1. Run the reset command to reset the node. The `--reboot` flag automatically reboots the machine to ensure that transient configuration is also reset.

    ```
    sudo ./APP_SLUG reset --reboot
    ```

    :::note
    Pass the `--no-prompt` flag to disable interactive prompts. Pass the `--force` flag to ignore any errors encountered during the reset.
